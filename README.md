# Yoga-with-AI

This project designed to bring the benefits of yoga practice right to your home, enhanced with the power of artificial intelligence.

## How It Works

**Video Capture**: Yoga with AI uses your device's camera to capture your yoga poses in real-time.

**Pose Detection**: The application employs PoseNet to detect key points of your body and analyze your posture.

**Progress Tracking**: Monitor your yoga session's duration, track your performance, and receive wellness insights.
